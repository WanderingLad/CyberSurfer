                        <p>
                            Consumed by The Void in year 2098, Earth was split in two, separate by a stable white hole. When the anomaly struck, most humans 
                            were pulled into the black hole. Other have traveled through, but some stayed on Earth, and have prospered in what has becomes a cybernetic-jungle
                            community. Primitive tribes were created, and new aged socifities emerged as the "Voidmans" returned from the black hole flying on Cyberboards.

                            A massive city, the integration passage for Robots and Humans, mending cultures and conflicts. The will to race among this panets inhabitants
                            is strong. A cybernetic street culture fuels the cities underground. The way to make big money in CyberCity... win a CyberSurfer race. Here lives
                            a grungy, crime ridden, lawlessness, place where communities are left to police, and race themselves.

                            Inorganics created a fully metal, abstract planet that houses only the most intelligent robots. Governed by AI this planes has become
                            a safe haven for only the most pristine species, namely inorganics. It is only open on occasion to cyborgs and humans. So that the "collective"
                            can study different race organics. With sensors and patrol bots, organics could never contaminate the ideal mechanical garden that is Assimilation.
